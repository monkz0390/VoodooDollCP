# VoodooDollCP
Voodoo Doll code in circuit python
voodoo doll was originally made using a circut playground classic board. This next version will be made with a circuit playground express board and written in circuit python instead of arduino. There were conceptualized features that were not feasable under the time constraints of the class, this time around there is no such time constraint and those features will be more throughly investigated and hopefully inplemented.
